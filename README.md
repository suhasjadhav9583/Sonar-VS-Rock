# Sonar-VS-Rock
it is a machine learning project implemented by a logistic regression algorithm with the help of the Kaggle dataset.it is a binary classification problem hence here we use the logistic regression algorithm.

# Workflow of the project
Sonar data(binary form)--->data preprocessing--->training and testing data--->logistic model(because it is a binary classification problem)-->identify the object whether it is rock or mine.

#the code is implemented on google Colab
